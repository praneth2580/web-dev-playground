## 🛠 Tech Stack

These projects primarily leverage standard web technologies without heavy frameworks:

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**

## 🚀 How to Run

Since these are mostly static projects, you can run them by simply opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

For a better experience, it is recommended to use a local development server:

1.  Refer to the specific project folder for any unique instructions (some may have their own `README.md`).
2.  Use a robust local server (like Live Server in VS Code) to ensure assets load correctly.
